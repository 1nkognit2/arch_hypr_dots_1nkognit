# How to install

## 1. Install Git
```
# Arch linux
sudo pacman -S git
```

## 2. Сlone dotfiles repository
```

Or, if you want to, clone development branch (may be very unstable, not always exists, only use if you know what you doing)
```
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/147888sf/arch_hypr_dots.git
```

## 3. Run install.sh bash script
```
cd arch_hypr_dots # moving into dotfiles dir
bash install.sh # starting installer bash script
```

## 4. Start hyprland
```
hyprland
```

Done!
